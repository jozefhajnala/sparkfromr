# Setting up Spark with R and sparklyr

An exhaustive list of instructions on setting up sparklyr is not in the scope of this book, below we  provide a quick set of instructions to get a local Spark instance working with sparklyr in an interactive setting. 

We have however prepared a dedicated Docker image that has all the prerequisities readily available to use. we recommend using this pre-built image for the best experience using this book.

## Interactive manual installation

The following are very basic instructions, for troubleshooting or more detailed step-by-step guides you can refer to RStudio's [spark website](https://spark.rstudio.com/#installation).

```{r r201_spark_installation, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("sparklyr")
install.packages("nycflights13")
sparklyr::spark_install(version = "2.4.3")
```
